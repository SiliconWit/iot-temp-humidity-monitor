# IoT-Based Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System

An IoT-based temperature and humidity monitoring system using Arduino, DHT11 sensor, and Python for data analysis. This beginner-friendly project is perfect for students looking to explore the Internet of Things and data visualization. This repository is based on https://siliconwit.com/iot/temperature-and-humidity-monitoring-system 

## Areas of Improvement

The current implementation of the IoT temperature and humidity monitoring system serves as a foundation for a beginner-friendly project. However, there are several areas where contributors can improve the project, making it more versatile and feature-rich:

* _Wireless communication:_ Integrate a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth module (e.g., ESP8266, HC-05) to send data wirelessly from the Arduino to a remote device or server. This allows for real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity data on a smartphone or computer, even from a distance.

* _Web dashboard:_ Develop a web dashboard to display temperature and humidity data in a user-friendly manner. This can be achieved using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web frameworks like Flask or Django.

* _Alerts and notifications:_ Implement a system to send alerts or notifications via email, SMS, or other messaging platforms when certain thresholds are met, such as when the temperature or humidity exceeds a predefined limit.

* _Data storage:_ Store the collected data in a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB) for long-term storage and analysis. This will allow for better historical data analysis and trend identification.

* _Advanced data analysis:_ Utilize machine learning techniques or statistical methods to predict future temperature and humidity levels, identify trends, or detect anomalies in the data.

* _Improved hardware design:_ Design and build a custom PCB or enclosure for the project, making it more robust and suitable for deployment in various environments.

* _Battery-powered operation:_ Integrate a battery power source and power management system to make the project portable and usable in locations without a direct power supply.

* _Additional sensors:_ Incorporate other environmental sensors, such as air quality sensors, light sensors, or sound sensors, to create a comprehensive environmental monitoring system.

By working on these areas of improvement, contributors can help enhance the project's functionality and expand its potential applications, making it more valuable and appealing to a broader audience.
